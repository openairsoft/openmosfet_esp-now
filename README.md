This library defines the data structures used by the (openmoseft)[https://github.com/openmosfet/openmosfet] esp-now API.

You should use this to develop you own esp-now based modules.

Here are some examples of what you can achieve with this :

 - replica killswitch (endpoint not yet implemented)
 - etc...
